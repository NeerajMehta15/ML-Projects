Project Description:
The Kathmandu Earthquake Damage Assessment project aims to address the critical need for assessing potential damage to buildings in Kathmandu, Nepal, in the event of earthquakes. Inspired by the devastating Nepal earthquake of 2015, this project endeavors to create a robust model capable of predicting the extent of damage to buildings based on various attributes such as house structure, geographic location, and family/usage patterns.

Key Features:
Data-driven Modeling: Utilizes data-driven approaches to develop a predictive model for earthquake damage assessment.
Multi-factor Analysis: Incorporates diverse factors including house attributes, geographical features, and socio-economic indicators to enhance accuracy.
Continual Improvement: Aims for continual improvement through community contributions, feedback, and iterative enhancements.

Potential Impact:
Risk Mitigation: Enables proactive measures by homeowners, policymakers, and disaster management authorities to mitigate earthquake risks and enhance preparedness.
Resource Allocation: Facilitates targeted resource allocation for disaster relief efforts by identifying high-risk areas and vulnerable structures.
Community Resilience: Empowers communities with valuable insights to strengthen resilience against natural disasters and foster sustainable urban development.
